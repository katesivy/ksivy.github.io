                        <h3>What did you learn about that helped you understand more about design?</h3>
                        <p>The principles of "CRAP" were basically new to me (beyond what common sense would have
                            dicated anyway). There are several criteria for good designs that have stuck with me since
                            our discussion about it, but the one that stuck with me the most is what the eye first sees
                            when it looks at a flyer/web page/etc. The primary content of your document should be the
                            first thing people see regardless of a cool design or other pieces of information that could
                            distract viewers.</p>

                        <h3>What do you want to continue learning about that helps you understand design better?</h3>
                        <p>I look forward to getting better aquainted with all of the elements of design, but contrast
                            is one area I feel less secure with than the others.</p>

                        <h3>What Design aspects are important to you as a user and as a developer?</h3>
                        <p>When I'm viewing a document, I appreciate not only having the main content being the focal
                            point, but also not having tons of stuff crowded around it or cramed onto the document. As a
                            developer, I want to make sure my product is easy for others to understand and navigate.</p>

                        <h3>What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?</h3>
                        <p>I was frustrated with myself this week on the Campaign Components project because I had a
                            hard time coming up with a design, and when I changed my mind about using the carousel and
                            then decided later to go back to it, I wasted a lot of time that I could have been using to
                            make my project more interesting. I didn't have a clear plan for what to do, so instead of
                            going through a list and trying to execute each idea, I found myself randomly searching
                            through Bootstrap pages for information that would give me ideas, which didn't get me very
                            far.</p>

                        <h3>What is one thing you would like to get better at in bootcamp?</h3>
                        <p>I feel like a total baby developer who needs to get better at absolutely everything, but
                            right now my biggest weakness is JavaScript. I look forward to not being so intimidated by
                            it and to feeling comfortable enough to use it creatively on my own.</p>
