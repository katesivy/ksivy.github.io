      <h3>1. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?</h3>
        <p>It seems like HTML provides the building blocks, CSS makes it attractive, and JavaScript makes it interesting and possible to interact with.</p>

      <h3>2. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?</h3>
        <p>I have a background image, tabs for the pages of each week & home, and my email and other contact info. The blog is usually saved for when I've finished my reading and assignments for the week, so it doesn't have as many objects as it should!</p>

      <h3>3. Aha moments:</h3>
        <p>I'm still waiting for my "Aha" moments to occur! The work earlier in the week was more an issue of remembering basic terms and rules about how CSS or JavaScript work generally; now that I'm having to apply these ideas and logic in things like Codewars katas, it's a whole different process.</p>
