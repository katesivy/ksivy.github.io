      <h3>1. Was your first week what you expected?</h3>
    <p>Overall, this first week was more difficult than what I was expecting. 
        I thought there would be some more baby steps before we had to really know what we were doing. 
        Justin keeps reminding us that discomfort is the desired state to be in; I've mastered that, at least! 
    </p>

    <h3>2. What are you struggling with?</h3>
        <p>Navigating through GitHub wasn't so bad, 
        but applying CLI in the terminal was brand new and the source of much stress!
        Generally, with CLI and GitHub, I feel like the commands and basic operations make sense in theory,
        but when it's time for me to execute them, it's overwhelming and then frustrating when I inevitably
        make the wrong choice.
        </p>
    
    <h3>3. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
        <p>I am looking forward to learning about HTML and about doing things that affect the appearance 
            of web pages. (I'm all about appearances, lol!) 
        </p>
    
    <h3>4. "Aha" moment of the week:</h3>
        <p>After being guided through setting up an index.html file in VS Code and
            then pushing it to GitHub, I felt like I didn't need to worry about the 1,000 other
        things I was trying to figure out and could just enjoy working with that set of commands. I'm still not 
        confident I really know what I'm doing, but it's a nice feeling to be able to tell my computer to do 
    certain things and have it actually do them! (If this past week was like telling all of us to drive somewhere
    and everyone else has gotten there by now, I feel like I figured out how to put the key in the ignition. 
    Baby steps.)
        </p>
    
    <h3>5. One cool thing I learned this week about coding:</h3>
        <p>A few days ago, someone on Slack referenced CLI, and I didn't know what he was talking about.
            Now, I not only know what it stands for, but I can use it correctly! (At least to a small extent
            at this point.)
