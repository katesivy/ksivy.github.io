      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <h3>Was your first week what you expected?</h3>
    <p>Overall, this first week was more difficult than what I was expecting. 
        I thought there would be some more baby steps before we had to really know what we were doing. 
        Justin keeps reminding us that discomfor is the desired state to be in; I've mastered that, at least!

    <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>
    <p>Navigating through GitHub wasn't so bad, 
        but applying CLI in the terminal was brand new and the source of much stress! 
        Justin walked me through the initial steps for creating a repo, working with VS Code, 
        and pushing the commits to GitHub, and now it makes a lot more sense. 
        Generally, with CLI and GitHub, I feel like the commands and basic operations make sense in theory,
        but when it's time for me to execute them, 
        </p>
    <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
        <p>I am looking forward to learning about HTML and about doing things that affect the appearance of things.
            (I'm all about appearance, Lol!)
