            Week 5
1.Why are CLIs scary?

2.What have you learned about CLIs?
3.Would you build a CLI? What would it do?

4.List a some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code
5.How do you feel now (week 5) compared to when you started?
I'm feeling a lot more proficient in so many ways. When I first started this bootcamp, I wasn't sure I knew how to connect to the internet, and now have learned so many things I don't even know where to begin listing them. I can tell I've grown in my "computational thinking" and am more secure in my ability to break down a problem into small enough parts that I can work through them and progress toward a solution.
6.What questions haven't you answered on your blog page yet (scroll up and answer them to catch up)?

Week 6
1.What do you like about React?
React makes it easier to understand the roles and relationships between parent components and their children. 
2.What are you struggling with the most about React?
It seems like there are multiple ways to do the same thing, and it's not always clear when to do what.
3.How has React caused you to rethink your existing projects?
I know my blog can be completely restructured with React, since it's still in vanilla JS right now. 
4.What is your biggest win this week? Halfway through!
I was able to fix my puzzle slider in 15 minutes after spending a whole day unable to re-click a tile that was previously clicked. For the majority of the puzzle slider assignment, I felt more comprehension of what I needed to do and how I needed to do it than I have for my other projects so far.
5.Compared to week three, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? Are they the same, or have they changed now that you understand more about the technology and your limitations? 
My final project ideas are still similar to what they were a few weeks ago, and they still are a bit fuzzy in my head. I think I'll have more clarity after we do some backend work in the coming weeks.

Week 7
1.What have you learned about PHP and server side programming that you were not aware of prior to this week?
Since I didn't even know what PHP and server side programming was before this week, I have learned a ton. One overall aspect I've learned about PHP is that it's a great tool to use to display specific information from databases, but it's got it's share of limitations as well. 
2.What do you want to know more about PHP and server side programming?
I would like to get more practice with and understanding of forms...different ways of setting them up and what all the connections are with how they're built and the information passed from them.
3.How has learning PHP been? What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS?
Learning PHP was fun when it was at the W3 Schools hand-holding stage, but it became less fun when we had to implement our knowledge in the much more complex, real-life version of our own PHP-built facebook. It is more similar to JS than I expected going in (thinking backend development might be completely different from front-end). I remember spending a long time figuring out how to display seconds with two digits in our JS countdown timer, and PHP does it automatically!
4.What if you had started with PHP instead of JS?
I think it might have been harder to learn JS after learning PHP, since JS has fewer "magic" functions, a bit like doing things by hand is harder when you come from using a calculator.
5.Are there any exercises you think would be improved if you refactored them to PHP from JS? Do you plan to?
I haven't made plans yet to refactor any projects, but I'm sure I'll get to that point when the main part of bootcamp is over. I can imagine things like the countdown timer or weather app could be simplified with PHP.
6.Find one library, framework, NPM package, and/or external web API you think you might want use for your final project.
Right now, I think React would be a good framework to use for my final project. It's capable of doing so much all at once, so I'm sure it would be a helpful tool.
