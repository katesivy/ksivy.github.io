    <h3>What was one thing you liked and disliked about each of the new topics covered in prework?</h3>
        
        <p>1. Starting with Git, there were no end to the things I disliked about it initially. It seemed like this nebulous thing that had no clear connection to anything in real life, yet was essential to operate succefully and impossible to figure out at the same time. I think I've gotten over my fear of it, after giving some commands incorrectly and being able to fix my mistakes (all by myself!). Now that I understand more of its connection to real life, I can appreciate that it creates folders to write code with and saves them and then puts them in a place where they transform into web pages that others can also see.</p>
        
        <p>2. HTML is so straight forward, and I especially appreciate that after working with JavaScript! You type in what you want to appear, and it appears, with no need for magic! You just have to follow the rules, which are fairly clear. It can be a little tedious with long documents, and of course there's nothing overly interesting or exciting about it. But it doesn't give me the headaches or levels of stress that I get with CSS and especially JavaScript!</p>

        <p>3. I like that CSS can do so much (and way more than I've experienced with it so far) with altering the layout of a page and can transform a document from looking like a Word document to looking like a decent web page. It's not as clear and simple as it seems at first, though; it has that same frustrating aspect as JavaScript where you type something that you expect to do one thing, and instead it does another or does nothing at all. Thankfully, unlike JavaScript, it doesn't cause everything to fail if you mess up CSS, so the level of frustration is less.</p>
        
        <p>4. JavaScript, if you can't tell by this point, is not quite my friend yet. We're getting there, though. I like how it is capable of so many things and how it relies on logic. But I don't enjoy spending long amounts of time working out complex ideas and formulas, only to have them not work because you forgot a comma somewhere. </p>
        
    <h3>What was helpful?</h3>
        <p>It was definitely helpful having Slack available to ask questions. Doing Google hangouts also saved me from hours of frustration and problems I could not have solved by myself.</p>

    <h3>What hindered your progress?</h3>
        <p>The biggest hindrance for my progress was lack of time. I'm sure I spent the minimum 16-20 hours and more each week on the work, but with work and family obligations interrupting parts of each day, there was never as much time as I would have liked before we were on to the next thing. And coming from almost zero knowledge of any of these topics, and even with little experience on a MacBook or using a computer for anything beyond surfing internet browsers, I needed extra time to figure things out and absorb information.</p>
