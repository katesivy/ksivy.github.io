        <h3>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h3>
        <p>It looks like an interesting topic that will be integral to our coming work. I'm sure it will get much more complicated pretty quickly!</p>


        <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>
        <p>I still find using Git to be the most intimidating aspect of the work so far, but I think I'm slowly but surely making strides with understanging the commands and am feeling more comfortable using them. </p>

        <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
        <p>While the basics of CSS are fairly straightforward, it seems like I could spend a whole month learning about each of the different commands and their effects on the layout of the page.</p>
