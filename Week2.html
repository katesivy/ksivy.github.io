        <h3>What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?</h3>
        <p>It looks like an interesting topic to explore. I'm sure it can get complicated pretty quickly.</p>


        <h3>What are you struggling with?</h3>
        <p>I still find using Git to be the most intimidating aspect of the work so far, but I think I'm slowly but surely making some strides with understanging the commands and how it works. While the basic commands make sense just fine when I read about them, it seems to always be more complicated when I have to use them myself. And it seems like there are several different methods for doing the same or similar things, so searching for help on the internet sometimes adds to my confusion more than resolving it.</p>

        <h3>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</h3>
        <p>I'm looking forward to learning more about CSS, since it's still fairly new to me.</p>
